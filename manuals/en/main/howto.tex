\label{testbackup}
If your are testing your configuration, but don't want to store the backup data,
it is possible to use a dummy FIFO device to test your configuration, see \ilink{Stored configuration}{SetupFifo}.

Obviously, it can not be used to do a restore.

\section{Backup Of Third Party Databases}
\index[general]{Backup Of Third Party Databases}
\index[general]{Database!Backup Of Third Party}
\label{BackupOtherDBs}

If you are running a database in production mode on your machine, Bareos will
happily backup the files, but if the database is in use while Bareos is
reading it, you may back it up in an unstable state.

The best solution is to shutdown your database before backing it up, or use
some tool specific to your database to make a valid live copy perhaps by
dumping the database in ASCII format.

\subsection{Backup Of MSSQL Databases with Bareos Plugin}
\index[general]{MSSQL Backup}
\index[general]{Database!MSSQL}
\label{MSSQL}

\sinceVersion{general}{MSSQL}{13.2}

\subsubsection {Preparation}
If you like to use the MSSQL-Plugin to backing up your Databases you need to consider some things:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Database Mode}\\
The database need to run in {\bf Full Recovery Mode}. Otherwise you are not able to use differential and incremental backups or to use point in time recovery.\\
\warning{If you set the databases into the mentionend mode you have to consider some maintance facts. The database doesn't shrink or delete the logs unanttended, so you have to shrink them manual once a week and you have to truncate the logs once in a month.}

\item {\bf Security and Access}\\
For connections you can use a SQL-User or a integrated systemaccount (Windows NT user). Both connection types are supported.
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Standard Security \\
You have to provide user credentials within your options which do belong to user with the sufficent right performing restores and backups from the database. This way stands for an extra backup/restore user.
	\item Trusted Security \\
	You use a systemaccount which have the sufficent rights to performing backups and restores on a database. This systemaccount have to be same account like the {\bf bareos-filedeamon} runs on.
	\end{itemize}
\item{\bf Permissions and Roles}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Server-Role\\
	The user should be in the groups {\bf sysadmin} and {\bf dbcreator}.
	\item Database permissions\\
	The user have to be a {\bf backupoperator} and {\bf dbowner} of the database which you like to backup.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
There is no difference for the rights and roles between using a systemaccount (trusted security method) or a extra backup user (standard security method).
Please keep in mind if you use the trusted security method you have to use the same system account like the bareos-filedeamon runs on.

\subsubsection{MSSQL Plugin Installation}
\label{MssqlPluginInstallation}

\paragraph{Bareos Windows-Installer}

Install the bareos fileadaemon on the MSSQL server computer and install also the component "Bareos FileDameon Plugins".
Make sure, that you install the file daemon {\bf without the "compatible" option}.\\

\paragraph{Manual install}

After downloading the plugin you need to copy it into \path|C:\Program Files\Bareos\Plugins|.
Then you need to define the plugin directory and which plugin the {\bf bareos-filedaemon} should use.
You have to edit the {\bf bareos-filedaemon} ressource in  \path|C:\Program Data\bareos-fd.conf| as followed.\\

\begin{bconfig}{MSSQL plugin configuration}
FileDaemon {
  Name = mssqlserver-fd
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20

  # remove comment in next line to load plugins from specified directory
  Plugin Directory = "C:/Program Files/Bareos/Plugins"

  # if compatible is set to yes, we are compatible with bacula
  # if you want to use new bareos features, please set compatible to no
  Plugin Names = "mssqlvdi"
  compatible = no
}
\end{bconfig}

%\warning{The Bareos filedaemon and Bareos director have to be the same version.}

\subsubsection{Plugin Test}

\begin{bconsole}{status client=mssqlserver-fd}
*<input>status client=mssqlserver-fd</input>

  log sequence number: 'lsn:15000000040000037'
\end{bconsole}

\subsubsection{Configure the FileSet}
\index[general]{Backupconfiguration}
\label{filesetconfig}
To use the plugin you need to configure it in the fileset as a plugin ressource. For each database instance you need to define a exclusive backup job and fileset.

\begin{bconfig}{MSSQL FileSet}
Fileset {
  Name = "Mssql"
  Enable VSS = no
  Include {
    Options {
      Signature = MD5
    }
    Plugin = "mssqlvdi:instance=default:database=myDatabase:username=bareos:password=bareos"
  }
}
\end{bconfig}

In this example we use the standard security method for the connection.

Used options in the plugin string are:

\begin{description}
  \item[mssqlvdi]
  This is the reference to the MSSQL plugin.
  \item[instance] Defines the instance within the database server.
  \item[database] Defines the database that should get backuped.
  \item[username and password] Username and Password are required, when the connection is done using a MSSQL user. If the systemaccount the bareos-fd runs with has succifient permissions, this is not required.
\end{description}

It is recommend to define an additional restore job. 

For every database seperat job and FileSet are required.

\subsubsection{Run Backups}

Here you can see an example for a backup:

\begin{bconsole}{run MSSQL backup job}
*<input>run job=MSSQLBak</input>

\end{bconsole}

At least you gain a full backup which contains the follow:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
@MSSQL/
@MSSQL/default/
@MSSQL/default/myDatabase/
@MSSQL/default/myDatabase/db-full
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

So if you perform your first full backup your are capable to perfom differntial and incremental backups.\\

Differntial FileSet example:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
/@MSSQL/
/@MSSQL/default/
/@MSSQL/default/myDatabase/
/@MSSQL/default/myDatabase/db-full
/@MSSQL/default/myDatabase/db-diff
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Incremental FileSet example:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
*@MSSQL/
  *default/
    *myDatabase/
      *db-diff
      *db-full
      *log-2013-11-21 17:32:20
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsubsection{Restores}

If you want to perfom a restore of a full backup without differentials or incrementals you have some options which helps you to restore even the corrupted database still exist. But you have to specifiy the options like plugin, instance and database during every backup.

\begin{description}
  \item[replace=\textless yes|no\textgreater]
  With this option you can replace the database if it still exist.
  \item[instance]
  Defines the server instance whithin the database is running.
  \item[database]
  Defines the database you want to backup.
\end{description}

Example for a full restore:

\begin{bconsole}{restore MSSQL database}
*<input>restore client=mssqlserver-fd</input>
Using Catalog "MyCatalog"

First you select one or more JobIds that contain files
to be restored. You will be presented several methods
of specifying the JobIds. Then you will be allowed to
select which files from those JobIds are to be restored.

To select the JobIds, you have the following choices:
     1: List last 20 Jobs run
     2: List Jobs where a given File is saved
     3: Enter list of comma separated JobIds to select
     4: Enter SQL list command
     5: Select the most recent backup for a client
     6: Select backup for a client before a specified time
     7: Enter a list of files to restore
     8: Enter a list of files to restore before a specified time
     9: Find the JobIds of the most recent backup for a client
    10: Find the JobIds for a backup for a client before a specified time
    11: Enter a list of directories to restore for found JobIds
    12: Select full restore to a specified Job date
    13: Cancel
Select item:  (1-13): <input>5</input>
Automatically selected FileSet: Mssql
+-------+-------+----------+-------------+---------------------+------------+

\paragraph{Restore a Backup Chain}

If you like to restore a specific state or a whole chain consists of full, incremental and differential backups you need to use the "norecovery=yes" option. After this the database is in "recovery mode". You can also use a option which put the database right after the restore back into the right mode. If you like to restore certains point with protocols or
"LSN" it it not recommend to work with this option.

\begin{description}
  \item[norecovery=\textless yes|no\textgreater]
  This option must be set to yes, if the database server should not do a automatic recovery after the backup. Instead, additional manual maintenace operations are possible.
  \item[recoverafterrestore=\textless yes|no\textgreater]
  With this command the database is right after backup in the correct mode. If you not use this you have to use the followed tsql statement:
  \footnotesize
  \begin{verbatim}
    Restore DATABASE yourDatabase WITH RECOVERY
    GO
  \end{verbatim}
  \normalsize
  \item[stopbeforemark=\textless log sequence number specification\textgreater]
  used for point in time recovery.
  \item[stopatmark=\textless log sequence number specification\textgreater]
  used for point in time recovery.
  \item[stopat=\textless timestamp\textgreater]
  used for point in time recovery.
\end{description}

Followed is a example for a restore of full, differential and incremental backup with a replace of the original database:

\begin{bconsole}{restore MSSQL database chain}

\subsection{Backup of a PostgreSQL Database}
\index[general]{PostgreSQL Backup}
\index[general]{Database!PostgreSQL!Backup}
\label{backup-postgresql}

In this section, we describe different methods how to do a full backup of the PostgreSQL database.


\subsubsection{Backup of a PostgreSQL Database by using the RunBeforeJob directive}
\index[general]{RunScript!Example}

One method to backup a PostgreSQL database is to call a \configdirective{RunBeforeJob} script to dump the database into a file and than backup it as a normal file.
After the backup, the file can be removed by a \configdirective{RunAfterJob} script.

The RunBeforeJob directive is configured inside a Job Resource, e.g.:
\begin{bconfig}{RunBeforeJob job resource for a PostgreSQL backup}
Job {
  Name = "BackupDatabase"
  JobDefs = "DefaultJob"
  Level = Full
  FileSet="Database"

  # This creates a dump of our database in the local filesystem
  RunBeforeJob = "pg_dumpall -U postgres > /var/lib/bareos/postgresql_dump.sql"

  # This deletes the dump in our local filesystem
  RunAfterJob = "rm /var/lib/bareos/postgresql_dump.sql"
}
\end{bconfig}

The corresponding FileSet configuration should look something like this, e.g.:
\begin{bconfig}{FileSet for a PostgreSQL dump file}
FileSet {
  Name = "Database"
  Include {
    Options {
      signature = MD5
      compression = gzip
    }
    # database dump file
    File = "/var/lib/bareos/postgresql_dump.sql"
  }
}
\end{bconfig}

\subsubsection{Backup of a PostgreSQL Databases by using the bpipe plugin}
\index[general]{bpipe!PostgreSQL backup}

Instead of creating a temporary database dump file,
the bpipe plugin can be used. 
For general information about bpipe, see the \ilink{bpipe plugin}{bpipe} section. 
The bpipe plugin is configured inside the Include section of a File Set, e.g.:
\begin{bconfig}{bpipe directive for PostgreSQL backup}
FileSet {
  Name = "postgresql-all"
  Include {
    Plugin = "bpipe:/POSTGRESQL/dump.sql:pg_dumpall -U postgres:psql -U postgres"
    Options {
      signature = MD5
      compression = gzip
    }
  }
}
\end{bconfig}

This causes the File Daemon to call bpipe plugin, which will write its data into the "pseudo" file \file{/POSTGRESQL/dump.sql} by
calling the program \command{pg_dumpall -U postgres} to read the data during backup. The \command{pg_dumpall} command outputs all 
the data for the database, which will be read by the plugin and stored in the backup. During restore, the data that was backed up will
be sent to the program specified in the last field, which in this case is psql. When psql is called, it will read the data sent to it by 
the plugin then write it back to the same database from which it came from.

This can also be used, to backup a database that is running on a remote host:
\begin{bconfig}{bpipe directive to backup a PostgreSQL database that is running on a remote host}
FileSet {
  Name = "postgresql-remote"
  Include {
    Plugin = "bpipe:/POSTGRESQL/dump.sql:pg_dumpall -h <hostname> -U <username> -W <password>:psql -h <hostname> -U <username> -W <password>"
    Options {
      signature = MD5
      compression = gzip
    }
  }
}
\end{bconfig}


\subsection{Backup of a MySQL Database}
\index[general]{MySQL Backup}
\index[general]{Database!MySQL!Backup}
\label{backup-mysql}

In this section, we describe different methods to do a full backup of a MySQL database.

\subsubsection{Backup of a MySQL Database by using the RunBeforeJob directive}
\index[general]{RunScript!Example}

One method to backup a MySQL database is to call a \configdirective{RunBeforeJob} script 
to dump the database into a file and than backup it as a normal file.
After the backup, the file can be removed by a \configdirective{RunAfterJob} script.

The RunBeforeJob directive is configured inside a Job Resource, e.g.:
\begin{bconfig}{RunBeforeJob job resource for a MySQL backup}
Job {
  Name = "BackupDatabase"
  JobDefs = "DefaultJob"
  Level = Full
  FileSet="Database"

  # This creates a dump of our database in the local filesystem
  RunBeforeJob = "mysqldump --user=<username> --password=<password> --opt --all-databases > /var/lib/bareos/mysql_dump.sql"

  # This deletes the dump in our local filesystem
  RunAfterJob = "rm /var/lib/bareos/mysql_dump.sql"
}
\end{bconfig}

The correspondig FileSet configuration should look something like this, e.g.:
\begin{bconfig}{RunBeforeJob fileset MySQL dump}
FileSet {
  Name = "Database"
  Include {
    Options {
      signature = MD5
      compression = gzip
    }
  # database dump file
  File = "/var/lib/bareos/mysql_dump.sql" 
  }
}
\end{bconfig}


\subsubsection{Backup of a MySQL Databases by using the bpipe plugin}
\index[general]{bpipe!MySQL backup}

Instead of creating a temporary database dump file,
the bpipe plugin can be used. 
For general information about bpipe, see the \ilink{bpipe plugin}{bpipe} section. 
The bpipe plugin is configured inside the Include section of a File Set, e.g.:
\begin{bconfig}{bpipe fileset for MySQL backup}
FileSet {
  Name = "mysql-all"
  Include = {
    Plugin = "bpipe:/MYSQL/dump.sql:mysqldump --user=<user> --password=<password> --opt --all-databases:mysql --user=<user> --password=<password>"
    Options {
      signature = MD5
      compression = gzip
    }
  }
}
\end{bconfig}

This can also be used, to backup a database that is running on a remote host:
\begin{bconfig}{bpipe directive to backup a MySQL database that is running on a remote host}
FileSet{
  Name = "mysql-all"
  Include {
    Plugin = "bpipe:/MYSQL/dump.sql:mysqldump --host=<hostname> --user=<user> --password=<password> --opt --all-databases:mysql --host=<hostname> --user=<user> --password=<password>"
    Options {
      signature = MD5
      compression = gzip
    }
  }
}
\end{bconfig}

If you do not want a direct restore of your data in your plugin directive, as shown in the examples above, 
there is the possibility to restore the dump to the filesystem first, which offers you more control over the restore process, e.g.:
\begin{bconfig}{bpipe directive to backup a MySQL database and restore the dump to the filesystem first}
FileSet{
  Name = "mysql-all"
  Include {
    Plugin = "bpipe:/MYSQL/dump.sql:mysqldump --host=<hostname> --user=<user> --password=<password> --opt --all-databases:/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/bpipe-restore.sh"
    Options {
      signature = MD5
      compression = gzip
    }
  }
}
\end{bconfig}

A very simple corresponding shell script (bpipe-restore.sh) to the method above might look like the following one:
\begin{bconfig}{bpipe shell script for a restore to filesystem}
#!/bin/bash
cat - > /tmp/dump.sql
exit 0
\end{bconfig}
